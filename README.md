# Complete_flux_upwinded

Implementation of the complete flux scheme with a piecewise linear approximation of the velocity field.

Comparisons with:
a. the homogeneous flux scheme (Scharfetter-Gummel)
b. the complete flux scheme with piecewise constant approximation of the velocity field

For more details about the implementation and the file(s), see Readme.txt
